With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
----------------------------
i=1
while i<6:
print(i)
i=i+1
----------------------->>
With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:
----------------------->>
With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:
i=1
while i<6:
i=i+1
if i==3:
continue
print(i)
------------------->>
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
